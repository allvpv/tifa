### `tifa` wraps the c library in zero-cost c++ interfaces

`tifa` is an extensively documented, zero-cost wrapper over the c library with
plenty of useful interfaces for c++ programmers. you can avoid linking against
`libstdc++` or `libc++` and produce tiny binaries while enjoying some of the
convenient c++ features like lambdas, templates, concepts or v-tables
